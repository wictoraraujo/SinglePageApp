# Create a Ecommerce Single Web Page

## This project is a model that simulates an ecommerce home page.

### This project was carried out with the purpose of simulating an e-commerce landing page that is responsive and adapts to all screen sizes on different devices.

### This project was created using Create-React-App.

### The technologies that were used in this project: 

* Html for creating the structure and content of the web page
* javascript to create the structure of the components and their actions.
* Scss was used to assign a style sheet to the components and the web page so that they would follow what was proposed in the layout.

* The BEM methodology was used within the style sheets, which proposes better code organization and class naming. The purpose of using it is to facilitate writing, reading, understanding and maintenance of the code later. 

### The layout that should be followed can be seen in the following link: <https://www.figma.com/design/e0xCp8OGgVlKZgsFf6yT66/Modelo-de-teste---Front-end?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=4KUebpoFsP5229AN-0>, as well as in the print below:
